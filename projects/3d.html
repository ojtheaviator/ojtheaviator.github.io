			<h3>3D printing</h3>
				
			<p>
			I got my 3D printer about 5 years ago, and shortly after getting it, the manufacturer shut down. So itâ€™s been a small adventure keeping it running. At one point, a lever broke which kept the filament engaged to the feed gear - I was able to repair the lever to a level sufficient to print its own replacement. At another point, I had an issue where the auto-level feature failed and the print head crashed into the print bed. After some troubleshooting, I found that there was inadequate strain relief on the auto-level probe. Whenever the carriage moved to the right, the sensor was disconnected and failed to give warning of an imminent crash. Having determined this, I replaced the probe and added new strain relief - there have been no problems since!
