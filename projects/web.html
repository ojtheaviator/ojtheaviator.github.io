			<h3>This Website</h3>
				
			<p>
			This very website has been one of my favorite projects. I’ve made various pages for myself in the past - learning the very basics of HTML and CSS, and then testing out the Bootstrap framework. However, I’d never been quite satisfied with those pages - each a fun learning experience but never matching my own style. So, during 2022’s winter break, I decided to design and code a new personal website. I mocked-up the basic design, styled after the CLIs I’d used to program Raspberry Pi’s and learn C at Purdue. Then, I refreshed my HTML and CSS skills, employing classes and stylesheets more extensively than I had in the past. After many hours of troubleshooting and testing across devices, I was able to get a consistent design which matched my mockup. And now I’m in the process of filling it up!
