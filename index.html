        Welcome to my website. I've designed it as a place to collect and showcase my 
        interests, also serving as a project in and of itself. One might describe this 
        website as a work in progress. In fact, the same might be said of me. However, 
        please do enjoy what I've compiled so far.
        </p>


        <h4>Navigation:</h3>
        
        <p>
        <span class="hlt red">Projects</span> include personal and self-motivated projects which I've completed 
        over the years. Additionally, it details some of the non-academic projects 
        which I've contributed to.
        </p>

        <p>
        <span class="hlt blue">Academics</span> serves as an overview of my academic progress at Purdue University. 
        Also included are class projects and TA experience.
        </p>

        <p>
        <span class="hlt green">Creative</span> is a gallery page, of sorts. The camera has been my fondest hobby 
        for several years, and I'm glad to present some of its results here. Interspersed with photography are 
        writings, as I see fit.
        </p>
        
        I hope you enjoy your visit!
